___ Descriptive Statistics are measures that summarize important features of data ,often with a single number.
Producing descriptive statistics is a common first step to take after cleaaning and preparing dataset for analysis.

             -------------Measures of Center-----------------

--- these are statistics that give us a sense of the "middle" of a numeric variable. common measures of center include mean , meadian,mode

                            %matplotlib inline
                     import numpy as np
                      import  pandas as pd
                      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   mtcars = pd.read_csv("../input/mtcars/mtcars.csv")
   mtcars= mtcars.rename(column ={"Unnamed":model})
   del mtcars["models"]
   mtcars.head()

     mtcars.mean()     // col mean
     mtcars.mean(axis=1)    // get the mean of each row

-- The median of a distribution is the value where 50% of the data lies below it and 50% lies about it.In essence, the meadian splits the data in half

                  mtcars.median()       // get the meadian of each col
-- normal data -same mean and meadian
   skewed data -- different mean and meadian

-- the mode of a variable is simply the value that appears most frequently.

      mtcars.mode()

 ---------------------Measures of Spread-----------------------------

Measures of spread(dispersion) are statistics that describe how data varies.While measures of tthe center give us the idea of the
typical value,measures of spread gives us a senses of how much the data tends to diverge from the 
typical value.
-- Range is the distance b/w the maximum and minimum observations:
              max(mtcars["mpg"])-min(mtcars["mpg"])   // range

         five_num=[ mtcars["mpg"].quantile(0)  , //0% of data
                      mtcars["mpg"].quantile(0.25),   //25 5itle
                     mtcars["mpg"].quantile(0.50),
                      mtcars["mpg"].quantile(0.75),
                      mtcars["mpg"].quantile(1.0) ]

           or  mtcars["mpg"].describe()

---- Interquantile range is the distance between the 3rd quantile and the 1st quantile

             mtcars["mpg"].quantile(0.75) - mtcars["mpg"].quantile(0.25)      

boxplot is the better way to visualise these 3rd ,1st quartile ,mean ,median,min and max

         mtcars["mpg"].var()           // give variance of this
         mtcars["mpg"].std()          // standard deviation 
abs_median_deviation =abs(mtcars["mpg"].meadian() - mtcars["mpg"])

 abs_median_deviation.median()       


____________________________________Skewness And Kurtosis_______________________________

Beyond measures of center and spread,descriptive statistics include measures that give me a sense of the shape
of the distriibution.      skewness measures the assymmetry of the distribution  while kurtosis measures
how much data is in the tails of a distribution v.s. the center.

             mtcars["mpg"].skew()         // check skewness
         mtcars["mpg"].kurt()                   // check kurtosis

To explore these two measures further, let's create some dummy data and inspect it:

        norm_data = np.random.normal(size=10000)
skewed_data =np.concatenate(np.random.normal(size=35000)+2,
np.random.exponential(size=50000)*(-1),axis =0)

uniform_data = np.random.uniform(0,2,size=100000)
peaked_data =np.concatenate(np.random.exponential(size=50000),np.random.exponential(size=50000)*(-1)),
                                  axis=0)

data_df= pd.DataFrame( {
                     "norm":norm_data,
                     "skewed":skewed_data,
                      "uniform":uniform_data,
                      "peaked":peaked_data})

     data_df.plot(kind ="density",figsize=(10,10),xlim=(-5,5));
          data_df.skew()
          data_df.kurt()
