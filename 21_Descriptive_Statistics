___ Descriptive Statistics are measures that summarize important features of data ,often with a single number.
Producing descriptive statistics is a common first step to take after cleaaning and preparing dataset for analysis.

             -------------Measures of Center-----------------

--- these are statistics that give us a sense of the "middle" of a numeric variable. common measures of center include mean , meadian,mode

                            %matplotlib inline
                     import numpy as np
                      import  pandas as pd
                      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   mtcars = pd.read_csv("../input/mtcars/mtcars.csv")
   mtcars= mtcars.rename(column ={"Unnamed":model})
   del mtcars["models"]
   mtcars.head()

     mtcars.mean()     // col mean
     mtcars.mean(axis=1)    // get the mean of each row

-- The median of a distribution is the value where 50% of the data lies below it and 50% lies about it.In essence, the meadian splits the data in half

                  mtcars.median()       // get the meadian of each col
-- normal data -same mean and meadian
   skewed data -- different mean and meadian

-- the mode of a variable is simply the value that appears most frequently.

      mtcars.mode()

 ---------------------Measures of Spread-----------------------------

Measures of spread(dispersion) are statistics that describe how data varies.While measures of tthe center give us the idea of the
typical value,measures of spread gives us a senses of how much the data tends to diverge from the 
typical value.
-- Range is the distance b/w the maximum and minimum observations:
              max(mtcars["mpg"])-min(mtcars["mpg"])   // range

         five_num=[ mtcars["mpg"].quantile(0)  , //0% of data
                      mtcars["mpg"].quantile(0.25),   //25 5itle
                     mtcars["mpg"].quantile(0.50),
                      mtcars["mpg"].quantile(0.75),
                      mtcars["mpg"].quantile(1.0) ]

           or  mtcars["mpg"].describe()

---- Interquantile range is the distance between the 3rd quantile and the 1st quantile

             mtcars["mpg"].quantile(0.75) - mtcars["mpg"].quantile(0.25)
