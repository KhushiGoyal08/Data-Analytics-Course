                          %matplotlib inline
                           import numpy as np
                           import pandas as pd
                mtcars =pd.read_csv("../input/mtcars/mtcars.csv")
                print(mtcars.head())
                mtcars.index = mtcars.model               // Set row index to car model
                del mtcars["model"]           // Drop car name column
               colmeans =mtcars.sum()/mtcars.shape[0]         // get column means
                colmeans

-- With the column means in hand ,we just need to subtract the column means from each row in an element-wise fashion to zero center the data.
   Pandas performs math operations involving DataFrames and columns on an element-wise row-by-row basis by default,so we can 
   subtract our column means series from the data set to center it:

                      centered = mtcars -colmeans
                      centered.describe()

Now that the data is centered , we-d like to put it on a common scale . One way to put data on a common scalle is to divide by the standard deviation
Standard deviation is a statistics that describes the spread of numeric data. The higher the standard deviation,the  data points tend to be spread away
from the mean value.(df.std())

                       column_deviations =mtcars.std(axis=0)
                       centered_and_scaled =ceentered/column_deviations
                       centered_and_scaled.describe()
